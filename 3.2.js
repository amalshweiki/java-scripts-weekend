    //1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total number of people on the bus.
    //    At the beginning, the bus is empty.
    let numberOfPeople=0;
    // 2. We will need to go through each bus stop one by one. To do that, we will use a loop.

    // 3. Inside the loop, each 'bus stop' is an array with two numbers:
    //    - The first number represents the people getting on the bus.
    //    - The second number represents the people getting off the bus.

    // 4. We need to update our total number of people on the bus at each stop.
    //    - We add the number of people getting on the bus to our total.
    //    - We subtract the number of people getting off the bus from our total.

    // 5. Repeat this process for each bus stop.

    // 6. At the end of our loop (after we've visited all the bus stops),
    //    our total will be the number of people left on the bus.

    // 7. Make sure to return this total from the function.
